  Etag:
    description: |
      The RFC7232 ETag header field in a response provides the current entity-
      tag for the selected resource. An entity-tag is an opaque identifier for
      different versions of a resource over time, regardless whether multiple
      versions are valid at the same time. An entity-tag consists of an opaque
      quoted string, possibly prefixed by a weakness indicator.
    example: W/"xy", "5", "7da7a728-f910-11e6-942a-68f728c1ba70"
    in: header
    name: Etag
    required: false
    schema:
      maxLength: 1024
      type: string
  IfMatch:
    description: |
      The RFC7232 If-Match header field in a request requires the server to
      only operate on the resource that matches at least one of the provided
      entity-tags. This allows clients express a precondition that prevent
      the method from being applied if there have been any changes to the
      resource.
    example: '"5", "7da7a728-f910-11e6-942a-68f728c1ba70"'
    in: header
    name: If-Match
    required: false
    schema:
      maxLength: 1024
      type: string
  IfNoneMatch:
    description: |
      The RFC7232 If-None-Match header field in a request requires the server
      to only operate on the resource if it does not match any of the provided
      entity-tags. If the provided entity-tag is `*`, it is required that the
      resource does not exist at all.
    example: '"7da7a728-f910-11e6-942a-68f728c1ba70", *'
